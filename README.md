## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Create Your Repository

You can start using this template by clicking the green "Use this template" button or cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fvena/typescript-library-template.git
cd typescript-library-template
```

### 2. Reset Git History

Reset the git history and initialize a fresh repository for your project:

**note**: This step is only necessary if you cloned this repository directly. If you used the template, the history is already reset.

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
```

### 3. Remove `package-lock.json` and update packages

Update the packages to the latest versions and remove the `package-lock.json` file:

```bash
rm package-lock.json

npx npm-check-updates --interactive --format group
npm install // only if you have not updated the dependencies
```

### 4. Create a new branch develop

I recommend creating a new branch to start your development:

```bash
git checkout -b develop
```

### 5. Update Project Information

Make sure to update the following files:

- `package.json`: Update `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `repository`and other relevant fields.
- `LICENSE`: Update the copyright year and author information.
- `README.md`: Replace this file with this [`README_TEMPLATE.md`](https://gist.github.com/fvena/b53eed2c878f16d3d589f85b10ab3e5c) and update the content.
- `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`: update the base option in the VitePress configuration file with your repository name:

  ```typescript
  export default defineConfig({
    ...
    base: '/typescript-library-template-pro/',
  });
  ```

The last step is committing the changes:

```bash
git commit -am "chore: update project information and configuration"
```

### 6. Get your GitHub personal access token if you don't have one

> You don't need to do this every time you create a new repository, only the first time. But you need save the token in a secure place, to use it in the next repositories.

1. Go to your GitHub account settings
1. Click on `Developer settings` > `Personal access tokens` > `Fine-grained tokens`
1. Click on `Generate new token (classic)`
1. Set the token name (ex: semantic-release)
1. Select the expiration date (no expiration date is recommended for personal projects)
1. In Repository access select `All repositories`
1. In Permissions select:

   - Commit statuses -> `Read & write`
   - Contents -> `Read & write`
   - Environments -> `Read-only`
   - Issues -> `Read & write`
   - Metadata -> `Read-only`
   - Pull requests -> `Read & write`
   - Secrets -> `Read-only`
   - Variables -> `Read-only`
   - Workflows -> `Read & write`

1. Click on `Generate token`
1. Copy the generated token and save it in a secure place. You won't be able to see it again.

### 7. Get your NPM token

1. Go to the [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com)
1. Log in to your account
1. In your avatar dropdown, click on `Access Tokens`
1. Click on `Generate New Token`
1. Set the token name (ex: library name)
1. Select `Automation` type and click on `Generate Token`
1. Copy the generated token

### 8. Add tokens to the GitHub repository secrets

To enable the CI/CD pipeline and publish your library to NPM, you'll need to set up a GitHub and NPM token:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
1. Click on `Settings` tab
1. Click on `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` in the left sidebar
1. Click on `New repository secret`
1. Use the `GH_TOKEN` and `NPM_TOKEN` as the secret name and paste the token value
1. Click on `Add secret`

### 9. Setup GitHub Pages for documentation

1. Go to your GitHub repository
1. Click on `Settings` tab

## 🔄 Development Workflow

This template now supports a dual workflow setup, allowing flexibility depending on the project size and team structure. Choose between a simple `develop` workflow or a task-based workflow with feature branches:

### Option 1: Simple `develop` Workflow

Best for solo developers or small projects.

1. Work directly in the `develop` branch.
1. Push changes to trigger the CI pipeline for linting and testing.
1. When ready to release:
   - Open a Pull Request from `develop` to `main`.
   - Merge the PR to trigger the release and deploy workflows.

### Option 2: Feature Branch Workflow

Recommended for larger projects or teams to improve collaboration.

1. Create branches for tasks using descriptive prefixes such as:
   - `feature/` for new features (e.g., `feature/add-login-page`).
   - `fix/` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/header-alignment`).
   - `chore/` for maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`).
   - `docs/` for documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-readme`).
   - 'refactor/' for code refactoring (e.g., 'refactor/update-logic').
   - 'test/' for test updates (e.g., 'test/update-unit-tests').
1. Work on your changes in the corresponding branch.
1. Open a Pull Request from the task branch to `develop`.
1. Once the PR is approved and merged, repeat steps 1–3 for additional tasks.
1. When ready to release:
   - Open a Pull Request from `develop` to `main`.
   - Merge the PR to trigger the release and deploy workflows.

### Best Practices: Protect the `main` Branch

To ensure stability and maintain the integrity of the `main` branch, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules** in your repository.
1. Click on `Add classic branch protection rule`.
1. Set the branch name pattern to `main`.

   - Enable **Require a pull request before merging** - this ensures that all changes are reviewed.
   - Disable **Require approvals** - this is optional, depending on your team's workflow.
   - Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging** - this ensures that all workflows pass.
   - Enable **Require branches to be up to date before merging** - this ensures that the branch is up to date.
   - Enable **Require linear history** - this ensures that the branch history is linear.
   - Enable **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** - this ensures that even admins follow the rules.

1. Click on `Create` to save the changes.

With these rules in place:

- The `main` branch will only accept changes via Pull Requests that pass all workflows.
- Developers cannot push directly to `main`, reducing the risk of accidental changes.

## 📦 Releasing a Version

Releases are automated using `semantic-release` and are triggered when a Pull Request is merged into the `main` branch. Here's what happens during a release:

1. **Commit Analysis:** Uses commit messages to determine the next semantic version (major, minor, or patch) based on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
1. **Release Notes Generation:** Automatically generates release notes using the commit messages.
1. **Changelog Update:** Appends the new release information to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
1. **Version Bump:** Updates the version in `package.json` and creates a new Git tag for the release.
1. **Publish to NPM:** Publishes the updated package to the NPM registry.
1. **Commit Changes:** Commits the updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` back to the repository
1. **Create GitHub Release:** Creates a release on GitHub with the release notes and associated artifacts.

## 📖 Documentation

This template includes a preconfigured docs folder powered by VitePress. To start writing documentation:

1. Edit or add markdown files in the docs folder.
1. Start a local preview with:

   ```bash
   npm run docs:dev
   ```

## 🧪 Check your library

### How do I check my library in a separate project?

> This method is ideal for testing your library in a completely separate project environment.

- Link your library to the global npm environment:

  1. Run `npm link` in your library's root directory.
  1. In the project where you want to use your library, run `npm link <your-library-name>`

- Unlink your library (optional):

  1. In the test project run `npm unlink <your-library-name>`.
  1. Run `npm unlink` in your library root.

- For more details, refer to the [npm link documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link).

### How do I check my library within the same repository?

> This approach is useful for quickly testing your library without setting up a separate project.

If you'd like to test your library directly within the same project, the best approach is to create a playground environment where you can link your library as a dependency. This allows you to test your library as if it were a published package.

### Generic Steps to Test a Library

1. **Create a testing environment**: Set up a playground folder in your project root (e.g., playground, examples, or similar).

1. **Configure the Testing Environment**: Depending on your library, set up the appropriate tooling in the playground (Vite, Vue, Vanilla, ...).

1. **Set the module type**: Update the `playground/package.json` to use ESM modules:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "module"
   }
   ```

1. **Add the playground as a workspace**: You need install all dependencies with the `npm install` command in the root folder, to pass the CI/CD pipeline.

   ```json
   {
     "workspaces": ["playground"]
   }
   ```

   **Important**: You need to build the library before running the linting and testing scripts. Update the `ci.yml` file to include the build step before running the tests:

   ```yaml
   - run: npm ci --ignore-scripts
   - run: npm run build
   - run: npm run lint
   - run: npm run typecheck
   ```

1. **Link the Library**: Add your library as a dependency in the `playground/package.json`. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "typescript-library-template-pro": "file:../"
     }
   }
   ```

   **Important**: After editing the package.json, install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Example for a Vanilla TypeScript Library

This example demonstrates how to set up a playground to test a TypeScript library. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Playground Folder**

   ```bash
   mkdir playground
   cd playground
   npm init -y
   ```

1. **Set the module type**: Update the `playground/package.json` to use ESM modules:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "module"
   }
   ```

1. **Link the Library**: Add your library as a dependency.

   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "typescript-library-template-pro": "file:../"
     }
   }
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. **Install TypeScript and Watcher**

   ```bash
    npm install typescript tsc-watch --save-dev
   ```

1. **Update Scripts**: Add the following scripts to the `playground/package.json` file:

   ```json
   {
    ...
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "tsc-watch --noClear --onSuccess \"node ./dist/index.js\"",
      "build": "tsc"
    },
   }
   ```

1. **Test your library**: Add a file, `index.ts`, in the `playground` folder:

   ```typescript
   import { add } from "typescript-library-template-pro";

   console.log(add(1, 2));
   ```

1. **Run both projects**: Run the library and the playground in separate terminals in watch mode:

   ```bash
    npm run dev
   ```

### Example for a Browser Library

This example demonstrates how to set up a playground to test a library that works in a browser environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Playground Using Vite**: Use the Vite assistant to scaffold a new project. In the root folder, run:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest playground
   ```

1. **Link the Library**: Add your library as a dependency in the `playground/package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "typescript-library-template-pro": "file:../"
     }
   }
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies:

   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

1. **Test your library**: Add library imports to the playground code, where you can test it:

   ```typescript
   import { add } from "typescript-library-template-pro";
   ```

1. **Run both projects**: Run the library and the playground in separate terminals in watch mode:

   ```bash
    npm run dev
   ```

<details id="how-do-i-adapt-the-library-for-browser-usage">
  <summary><strong>How do I adapt the library for browser usage?</strong></summary>

> By default, this template is optimized for Node.js, but it can be easily adapted for browser environments. Follow these steps:

1. **Update TypeScript Configuration**: Add browser-specific settings to your `tsconfig.json` file:

   ````json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "lib": ["ESNext", "DOM"],
       "target": "ESNext",
       "module": "ESNext",
       "moduleResolution": "node",
       "outDir": "./dist",
       "rootDir": "./src",
       "types": ["node"]
     }
   }

   ```json
   {
      "extends": "personal-style-guide/typescript/browser"
   }
   ````

1. **Configure EsLint**: If your library uses browser-specific APIs, update the ESLint configuration to include the browser environment:

   ```javascript
   import eslintBrowser from "personal-style-guide/eslint/browser";

   export default [...eslintBrowser];
   ```

1. **Configure Testing Environment**: If your library uses browser-specific APIs, set up `jsdom` as your testing environment:

   ```bash
    npm install jsdom --save-dev
   ```

   Then, configure Vitest to use `jsdom` in the `vitest.config.ts` file:

   ```typescript
   import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

   export default defineConfig({
     test: {
       environment: "jsdom",
       globals: true,
     },
   });
   ```

1. **Test in Browser Environment**: You can now test your library in a browser environment. For example, you can test the `localStorage` API:

   ```typescript
   test("localStorage works in browser environment", () => {
     localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
     expect(localStorage.getItem("key")).toBe("value");
   });
   ```
